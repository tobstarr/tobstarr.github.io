# Ubuntu on the Desktop

* status quo
	- no more driver problems
	- looks nice enough
	- iPhone "just mounts"
	- sound works
	- external monitor works

* ubuntu desktop
	- installs in 5 minutes
	- unity: bad window manager but nice defaults for fonts

* ruby: rbenv

* go: curl

* vim: compile yourself

* performance:
	- much nicer to older hardware
	- feels snappier on same hardware

* slack: works well in chromium

* docker
	- multiple versions of a specific part of the infrastructure (e.g. mysql, postgres)
	- pre-test prod deployments
	- not bound to system packages
	- transparent
	- test OS behavior without messing the OS up

* gnome:
	- not much setup required
	- ssh and gnupg key management out of the box
	- necessary config: e.g. no tool needed for "maximize screen"
	- problem: binary configuration

* terminal: gnome-terminal as good as iTerm/Terminal (if you use tmux anyway)

* update of system packages "out of the box" (better then homebrew)

* gnu-tools: e.g. time, find, zcat work out of the box, no cheating for e.g. 

* system monitoring
	- proc filesystem
	- upstart/systemd
	- htp/glances

* extra tools out of the box
	- disk analzyer out of the box (compared to GrandPerspective)
	- gparted

* same system as on the server

* dash: zeal

* browser: firefox, chromium work fine

* issues
	 - retina display
	 - power management
	 - spotify
	 - AppleTV
	 - iOS stuff
	 - graphic stuff (e.g. photoshop, sketch)

* how to start: vmware fusion
